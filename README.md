# Actuarial Analyst
**Actuarial analysts provide pivotal financial information to financial institutions, insurance companies, and other businesses. They predominantly analyze data using statistical modeling and complex mathematical formulas to assess risk. Actuarial analysts report to credentialed actuaries.**

**Actuarial science is a deeply sought-after field that plays a high role in the success of a company. Actuarial analysts help accredited actuaries make strategic decisions and communicate solutions for deeply complex financial issues.**

**Many types of companies find value in hiring actuarial analysts. Some of the most common employers of actuarial analysts are insurance companies, consulting firms, government, hospitals, banks, and investment firms. There is typically a divide between those in life disciplines (life and health insurance) and those in non-life disciplines (auto, home, and property insurance).**

**The day-to-day role of an actuarial analyst involves quite a bit of mathematical work and analysis. It’s a fairly competitive field, meaning that commitment and strong collegiate performance can give you a leg up when searching for a job.**

## If you’re looking for a professional career that involves solving problems, working with tons of numbers, and analysing data, well, the becoming an actuarial analyst may just be the job for you!

### Learn about the key requirements, duties, responsibilities, and skills that should be in an actuarial analyst job description.

### Actuarial science 
It is a field of mathematics which studies and quantifies financial risk using probability and statistics. Students of actuarial science analyze financial implications of future events using mathematical and statistical methods.

Insurance companies, pension providers and various financial firms employ different types of actuaries to analyze their risks and liabilities, improve their financial decision making and evaluate the impact of financial and economic events.

Many colleges and universities offer a graduate degree in actuarial science which consists of several interrelated subjects like mathematics, statistics, economics, finance, probability theory and computer science.

Getting a degree in actuarial science is challenging. You need to pass a series of actuarial exams that will make you a certified actuary. It requires that you have fairly good technical, mathematical and analytical skills.

### What Is Financial Risk?
Financial risk is the possibility of losing money in a business venture or investment. There are several types of financial risks, such as credit risk, liquidity risk, and operational risk. A financial risk is a potential loss of capital to an interested party.

In other words, financial risk is a danger that can translate into the loss of capital. It relates to the odds of money loss. 

In case of a financial risk, there is a possibility that a company’s cash flow might prove insufficient to satisfy its obligations. Some common financial risks are credit, operational, foreign investment, legal, equity, and liquidity risks. 

In government sectors, financial risk implies the inability to control monetary policy and or other debt issues. Learn more about how financial risk is associated with different sectors, be it business, government, market, or individuals. 

#### Types of Risks
Risk can be referred to like the chances of having an unexpected or negative outcome. Any action or activity that leads to loss of any type can be termed as risk. There are different types of risks that a firm might face and needs to overcome. Widely, risks can be classified into three types: Business Risk, Non-Business Risk, and Financial Risk.

+ **Business Risk:** These types of risks are taken by business enterprises themselves in order to maximize shareholder value and profits. As for example, companies undertake high-cost risks in marketing to launch a new product in order to gain higher sales.
+ **Non- Business Risk:** These types of risks are not under the control of firms. Risks that arise out of political and economic imbalances can be termed as non-business risk.
+ **Financial Risk:** Financial Risk as the term suggests is the risk that involves financial loss to firms. Financial risk generally arises due to instability and losses in the financial market caused by movements in stock prices, currencies, interest rates and more.

### Types of Financial Risks
Risk Types: The different types of risks are categorized in several different ways. Risks are classified into some categories, including market risk, credit risk, operational risk, strategic risk, liquidity risk, and event risk.

Financial risk is one of the high-priority risk types for every business. Financial risk is caused due to market movements and market movements can include a host of factors. Based on this, financial risk can be classified into various types such as Market Risk, Credit Risk, Liquidity Risk, Operational Risk, and Legal Risk.

#### Market Risk:
This type of risk arises due to the movement in prices of financial instrument. Market risk can be classified as Directional Risk and Non-Directional Risk. Directional risk is caused due to movement in stock price, interest rates and more. Non-Directional risk, on the other hand, can be volatility risks.

#### Credit Risk:
This type of risk arises when one fails to fulfill their obligations towards their counterparties. Credit risk can be classified into Sovereign Risk and Settlement Risk. Sovereign risk usually arises due to difficult foreign exchange policies. Settlement risk, on the other hand, arises when one party makes the payment while the other party fails to fulfill the obligations.

#### Liquidity Risk:
This type of risk arises out of an inability to execute transactions. Liquidity risk can be classified into Asset Liquidity Risk and Funding Liquidity Risk. Asset Liquidity risk arises either due to insufficient buyers or insufficient sellers against sell orders and buys orders respectively.

#### Operational Risk:
This type of risk arises out of operational failures such as mismanagement or technical failures. Operational risk can be classified into Fraud Risk and Model Risk. Fraud risk arises due to the lack of controls and Model risk arises due to incorrect model application.

#### Legal Risk:
This type of financial risk arises out of legal constraints such as lawsuits. Whenever a company needs to face financial losses out of legal proceedings, it is a legal risk.

### Insurance obligation
what it means, is that on any date, the sum of (a) all Reimbursement Amounts, (b) all accrued and unpaid premium and charges for "Unutilized Credit Limit Capacity" under the Insurance Policy and (c) all other accrued and unpaid amounts then due and payable to the Insurer under the Insurance Policy and any other Transaction Document.

#### What is the meaning by obligation?
An act of making oneself responsible for doing something(as a promise or contract) that requires one to do something.

#### What is an example of a obligation?
For example, if you owe or will owe money to anybody, that is one of your financial obligations. Almost any form of payment or financial security represents a financial obligation.

### What Is Reinsurance?
Reinsurance is also known as insurance for insurers or stop-loss insurance. Reinsurance is the practice whereby insurers transfer portions of their risk portfolios to other parties by some form of agreement to reduce the likelihood of paying a large obligation resulting from an insurance claim.

The party that diversifies its insurance portfolio is known as the ceding party. The party that accepts a portion of the potential obligation in exchange for a share of the insurance premium is known as the reinsurer.

### How Reinsurance Works
Reinsurance allows insurers to remain solvent(having assets in excess of liabilities; able to pay one's debts) by recovering some or all amounts paid to claimants. Reinsurance reduces the net liability on individual risks and catastrophe protection from large or multiple losses. The practice also provides ceding companies, those that seek reinsurance, the capacity to increase their underwriting capabilities in terms of the number and size of risks.

According to the Insurance Information Institute, Hurricane Andrew caused $15.5 billion in damage in Florida in 1992, causing seven U.S. insurance companies to become insolvent(unable to pay debts owed).

By spreading risk, an individual insurance company can take on clients whose coverage would be too great of a burden for the single insurance company to handle alone. When reinsurance occurs, the premium paid by the insured is typically shared by all of the insurance companies involved.

If one company assumes the risk on its own, the cost could bankrupt or financially ruin the insurance company and possibly not cover the loss for the original company that paid the insurance premium.

For example, consider a massive hurricane that makes landfall in Florida and causes billions of dollars in damage. If one company sold all the homeowners insurance, the chance of it being able to cover the losses would be unlikely. Instead, the retail insurance company spreads parts of the coverage to other insurance companies (reinsurance), thereby spreading the cost of risk among many insurance companies.

Insurers purchase reinsurance for four reasons: To limit liability on a specific risk, to stabilize loss experience, to protect themselves and the insured against catastrophes, and to increase their capacity.  But reinsurance can help a company by providing the following:

+ **Risk Transfer:** Companies can share or transfer specific risks with other companies.
+ **Arbitrage:** Additional profits can be garnered by purchasing insurance elsewhere for less than the premium the company collects from policyholders.
+ **Capital Management:** Companies can avoid having to absorb large losses by passing risk; this frees up additional capital.
+ **Solvency Margins:** The purchase of surplus relief insurance allows companies to accept new clients and avoid the need to raise additional capital.
+ **Expertise:** The expertise of another insurer can help a company obtain a higher rating and premium.

#### Reinsurance occurs when multiple insurance companies share risk by purchasing insurance policies from other insurers to limit their own total loss in case of disaster. Described as "insurance of insurance companies" by the Reinsurance Association of America, the idea is that no insurance company has too much exposure to a particularly large event or disaster

### What is an actuarial analyst?
Before we talk about what an actuarial analyst is, it’s important that you first understand what an actuary is. Because, an actuarial analyst is just the job title of someone that is working in a role as an actuary, but isn’t yet a fully qualified actuary.

#### Actuary Job Details
An actuary is someone that quantifies risk. They use statistics, probabilities, and financial concepts in order put a financial dollar value on an event that may or may not occur in the future.

They typically work in insurance companies determining how much to charge for insurance policies, or figuring out how much money an insurance company needs to save in order to keep their commitments to policyholders.

The key thing to understand here is that becoming a fully qualified actuary takes many years. Usually between 7-10 years actually. But anyone that is in the process of becoming an actuary can still work in the actuarial field (as an actuarial analyst) before they’re fully qualified.

#### Why work as an analyst?
This allows them to gain valuable work experience and industry knowledge well before they’re fully qualified. That’s important because fully qualified actuaries have a huge amount of responsibility and their job requires lots of professional judgement that can only be attained through years of experience.

So, sometimes the job title of an actuary that isn’t yet fully qualified is “actuarial analyst”. But this is just a job title. Another common job title (which means the exact same thing) is “actuarial associate”.

In some cases, the job title may just be “actuary”, “pricing actuary”, “valuation actuary” or something else along those lines. The job titles often vary from company to company.

#### What does an Actuarial analysts do?
Actuarial analysts use statistical models to analyze data and assess risk. Many industries employ actuarial analysts, but the insurance industry particularly uses their knowledge and skills to design and price insurance policies.

It’s most common for an actuarial analyst to be heavily involved in either the calculation of insurance premiums or reserves. Reserves are the industry term for the amount of assets (bonds, stocks, mortgages, private placements, etc.) that an insurance company needs to own in order to ensure that they are financially stable.

Since insurance contracts can last 50+ years, it’s important that insurance companies properly manage their cash flows to ensure they have enough money to pay any insurance claims that are made in the future. That’s why reserves are so important.

An actuarial analyst isn’t a fully qualified actuary and is still gaining knowledge and expertise in their industry. Because of this, they often do much of the technical work required in order for their immediate manager (usually a fully qualified actuary) and upper management to make informed decisions.

By doing much of the technical work, an actuarial analyst is able to dig deep into the details and fully understand how actuarial processes work, how reported values are calculated, and they’ll often investigate inconsistencies in data.

Having this in-depth insight into the business workings allows the actuarial analyst to develop in their career and become prepared for the requirements of a fully-qualified actuary.

### How do I become an actuarial analyst?
There are two primary requirements that are necessary in order to be an actuarial analyst. First, you need to get a Bachelor’s degree, and second you need to pass at least 1 actuarial exam.

### Bachelor’s Degree
Due to the nature of an actuarial analyst position, you need to be well-versed in topics such as finance, business, statistics and economics.

As a result, the first thing you’d need to do in order to become one is get a Bachelor’s degree. It doesn’t have to be a degree in one of the fields listed above, but it would be helpful in your career if it was. Actually, a degree technically isn’t required, but nearly all good candidates have one and an actuarial employer would be unlikely to hire someone without one.

Another option is to get your Bachelor’s degree in “actuarial science”. These courses are only offered in certain colleges and universities. They teach math concepts that are very specific to the actuarial field.

## Job Responsibilities are the Main Difference
Aside from those requirements and the salary, there is a big difference in the job responsibilities of an actuarial analyst and a fully qualified actuary.

### The Actuary
A fully-qualified actuary will often be using their knowledge and expertise in order to make critical business decisions. They’ll rely extensively on their past experiences in the industry, as well as concepts learned by studying for the later actuarial exams.

They’ll often use data summaries, industry reports, and company objectives in order to make decisions that are best for the company overall. To do this, an actuary will regularly collaborate with other actuaries in the company in order to get different perspectives, discover potential drawbacks and ideas.

Combining expertise in this way can be very powerful and reduces the possibility of overlooking potential issues that may arise in the future.

### The Actuarial Analyst
On the other hand, an actuarial analyst often isn’t involved in as many of these high-level, decision-making collaborations. Instead, the analyst is typically responsible for collecting, analysing and summarizing all the data that is needed for the fully-qualified actuaries to make their decisions.

The actuaries need to take into consideration many different factors when making decisions, and quite often it requires large amounts of data to be summarized into numbers that can easily be interpreted. This is where the analyst comes in.

The analyst will put everything together for the actuaries that they report to. This gives the actuaries more time for higher-level thinking and decision making rather than being caught up in the weeds of all the data.

Analysts are often also responsible for the monthly, quarterly, and annual reporting processes that need to be completed by the actuarial departments. These are often fairly manual processes that require the analyst to fully understand the data, calculations and results.

Although analysts may not attend all the collaboration meetings, their inputs and perspectives are still very valuable. Oftentimes the actuary that they’re providing data to doesn’t know all the nuances of the data, calculations and results that are produced.

So, an analyst can make them aware of any potential problems that may arise in the actual implementation of business changes and decisions.

As may be expected, the job responsibilities of an actuarial analyst are much more technical than those of an actuary. But both are needed in order to allow the insurance company to function.

### Actuarial Analyst vs Actuarial Assistant. Are they the same?
An actuarial analyst and an actuarial assistant are not the same job. An actuarial analyst does most of the technical work involving gathering, analysing, and interpreting data whereas an actuarial assistant often works alongside a team of actuarial analysts. The assistant will help do the tasks that need to be done but don’t require the expertise and skill set of the analysts.

In order to do their job, and actuarial analyst often needs to know how to write code to automate tasks. They also spend time formatting reports, cleaning data, and entering data into the computer.

But, these tasks aren’t really utilizing the specialized knowledge and analytical abilities of the analyst. So, it makes sense to have someone else do these tasks rather than the analyst. The analyst can then spend more time on understanding and interpreting results.

Having an actuarial assistant also makes sense from a financial standpoint because they don’t need to be paid as high of a salary as an actuarial analyst would.

Having actuarial assistants is a company choice. Some companies have them, and others don’t. But for someone looking to get into an actuarial analyst position, an actuarial assistant job can be very beneficial in making connections and learning about actuarial work.

## Is the actuarial analyst career right for you?
Most people don’t go into the actuarial profession without the intention to become a fully qualified actuary. The actuarial analyst job is a stepping stone on that journey. So, really, you have to think about whether a career as an actuary is right for you.

If you decide to stop pursuing a career as an actuary and stay as an actuarial analyst, you’ll be limited in your career growth opportunities and it may be difficult to switch companies (to another actuarial analyst position). Your exam process and work ethic will play a big part in whether this is possible.

#### You need to be goal oriented and persistent.
Getting through all the actuarial exams can be quite a long and difficult process. You need to be able to persevere through failures, and enjoy the challenge that each exam brings.

If you’re goal oriented, you’ll strive to complete the exams quickly, and the reward of a raise will motivate you.

#### Love problem solving.
Actuarial work regularly involves figuring out solutions to problems and a lot of judgement. Typically there’s no right or wrong answer in this field so it’s an analyst’s job to determine creative solutions and assess the advantages and disadvantages of each.

#### Enjoy math and working with numbers (a lot).
Actuaries work with numbers every single day. Most of them love to dig into the details and figure out why trends are occurring. Actuaries use numbers and mathematical concepts in order to make business decisions that are in the best interest of the company and its policyholders.

**`If you’re not good at math or don’t enjoy it, a career as an actuary likely won’t interest you for very long.`**

### Skills an actuarial analyst needs
Not everyone is cut out for the life of an actuarial analyst; it takes a very special set of skills. Thankfully, many of these skills are not inherent and can be developed through determination and hard work. These necessary skills are: 

+ Specialized math knowledge in calculus, statistics, and probability
+ Analytical, project management, and problem solving skills
+ Finance, accounting, economics
+ Interpersonal communication

Computer skills such as simple coding, formulating spreadsheets, running statistical analysis programs, database manipulation, and programming languages
An actuarial analyst must be self-motivated, creative, both independent and collaborative at times, and have a strong sense of ambition. Having an understanding for the common industries that actuarial analysts are employed in such as insurance, banking, and government can also set you ahead as a candidate in the field.

## 12 Types Of Actuaries And Their Role Description

Actuarial science is a field of mathematics which studies and quantifies financial risk using probability and statistics. Students of actuarial science analyze financial implications of future events using mathematical and statistical methods.

Insurance companies, pension providers and various financial firms employ different types of actuaries to analyze their risks and liabilities, improve their financial decision making and evaluate the impact of financial and economic events.

Many colleges and universities offer a graduate degree in actuarial science which consists of several interrelated subjects like mathematics, statistics, economics, finance, probability theory and computer science.

Getting a degree in actuarial science is challenging. You need to pass a series of actuarial exams that will make you a certified actuary. It requires that you have fairly good technical, mathematical and analytical skills.

### There are many different types of actuaries employed across various industries with insurance sector being the top recruiter. Let’s have a look at who they are and what they do.

+ **Life Insurance Actuary**
+ **Health Insurance Actuary**
+ **Pension Actuary**
+ **Property And Casualty Actuary**
+ **Enterprise Risk Management Actuary**
+ **Investment Actuary**
+ **Finance Actuary**
+ **Pricing Actuary**
+ **Valuation Actuary**
+ **Reinsurance Pricing Actuary**
+ **Corporate Actuary**
+ **Forensic Actuary**

### Life Insurance Actuary
Among all the actuaries, life insurance actuary is one of the most common. These types of actuaries work for insurance and reinsurance companies which offer products like whole life insurance and term life insurance.

Insurance companies sell thousands of policies every year. Life insurance actuaries help these companies to properly price the life insurance policy and determine the insurance premium for such policies.

Life insurance actuaries use mortality rates to find out the percentage of people that will die in any given year. The mortality rate for any person depends on various factors like age, gender and smoking status.

They use these mortality rates to find out what should be the insurance premium for different policies. Someone who is expected to live more than 30 years will pay lower premium than someone who is expected to live less than 10 years.

Life insurance claims are very hard to predict accurately as these are high cost low frequency claims. There is lot of variability involved in the amount insurance company has to pay each year.

Life insurance actuaries also have to take into account the lapse rate which is the rate at which the policyholders cancel their policies. High frequency of early cancellations can result in high insurance premiums because most of the expenses are incurred at the beginning of the policy.

### Health Insurance Actuary
Health insurance actuaries work with health insurance companies and help them to predict the actual cost of healthcare covered under insurance contract. These predictions are based on various factors like family history, occupation and geographical location.

Mostly health insurance actuaries are involved in designing group insurance plans which cover employer disability, dental, health and medication. They also provide policies to people who are self employed or employees who are not covered by their employer.

Actuaries that work in disability insurance try to predict how many policyholders will be unable to work each year and how much money insurance company will have to pay these policyholders to replace their lost income.

These types of actuaries also have to determine how soon the policy holder can get back to work because the longer the policyholder is out of work the longer the insurance company have to pay them.

Health insurance claims are fairly easy to predict accurately as these are considered as low cost high frequency claims. Health insurance actuaries use past data in order to predict how much money the policyholders will be spending on prescription drugs, dental benefits and health related sessions.

These types of actuaries use lot of data for analysis and most of the data is collected from policyholders. They also have to take into account the demographics, lapse rates, claim frequency and increasing medication costs.

### Pension Actuary
Pension actuaries are responsible for calculating the employer’s contribution as well as retirement benefits of pension plan participants. These types of actuaries help the plan sponsors to calculate sufficient balance required to fund the retirement benefits of pension plan participants.

These calculations are based on various assumptions about future events like retirement, disability, death and termination of employment. They also take into account the future economic events like interest rates and increase in salaries.

Pension actuaries do not deal with any insurance product but they create and price investment and annuity products which help the individuals to be financially prepared after retirement. These types of actuaries work with employers to develop retirement pension plans for employees.

Pension actuaries use current interest rates to determine the pricing of annuities. If interest rates rise, then the price of annuity will decrease as the insurance company will be able to earn more form increasing interest rates.

Pension actuaries try to predict how long people will live and how long people will be receiving payments. They also use mortality rates to determine the price of an annuity. Since mortality rates are higher among older people, pension actuaries would expect fewer annuity payments, hence reducing the price of the annuity.

### Property And Casualty Actuary
Property and casualty actuaries are one of the most common types of general actuaries or non-life actuaries. They work with general insurance companies and help them develop insurance policies that ensure against property loss and liabilities resulting from accidents, natural disasters or any other events.

These types of actuaries use their skills to analyze the risk emerging from climate change, ride sharing, automated vehicles and cyber liability. They are also responsible for pricing, predictive modeling, capital and risk management, strategic and financial management and catastrophe modeling.

Claims under property and casualty insurance are considered as high frequency low severity claims. These types of claims are easy to predict accurately. Vehicle insurance actuaries predict the probability of the policyholder getting into an accident and also the cost of the accident.

Property insurance actuaries determine the likelihood of property getting damaged from flooding, fire, extreme weather and anything else that can cause damage to the property. Such policy also covers for the loss due to theft of the items within the house.

Similar to health insurance actuaries, these types of actuaries also collect most of their data from policyholders. Demographics play an important role and due to high frequency of claims there is lot of data available for analysis.

Companies that provide property and casualty insurance in high crime areas will demand a higher premium for their insurance policies compared to the companies which insures people in low crime areas.

### Enterprise Risk Management Actuary
Enterprise risk management is a process of identifying critical risks faced by an organization, prioritizing them, quantifying their financial impact and developing organizational solutions to address them.

Primary responsibility of an enterprise risk management actuary is to consolidate all the risks which are faced by the company and determine the financial impact due to those risks. Their skills are not just limited to insurance companies.

One of the examples of an ERM actuary is to determine the cost and the potential impact of negative reputation on the organization. Any negative reputation would result in lower sales, lower revenue and legal charges.

Depending upon the severity, loss of reputation can even force the company to go out of business. The ERM actuary recognizes this and encourages the company to keep enough capital to survive such situations.

This is very important for insurance companies as thousands of people rely on them to collect insurance claims when the time comes. Enterprise risk management can prevent such companies from going out of business and protect their policyholders.

### Investment Actuary
Investment actuary is an actuary that either manages investments directly or provides an advice on how to manage investments. As with all the actuaries, their main focus tends to be on risk management.

Investment actuaries work in areas like investment banking, investment consulting, investment management and retail financial advice. They are also involved in day to day activities in capital markets, derivative markets, forex and property markets.

Investment actuaries have strong analytical skills and deep understanding about interaction between assets and liabilities which is very important while advising or managing assets backing insurance and pension liabilities.

### Finance Actuary
Finance actuaries work in areas like corporate finance, mergers and acquisitions, capital management and financial reporting. They have strong understanding about the working of insurance companies and other financial institutions.

Finance actuaries and financial analysts have very similar responsibilities as they both are involved in analyzing the data and reducing the risk of financial troubles. However, finance actuaries work closely with insurance companies whereas financial analysts are more focused on investment strategies.

The job responsibility of a finance actuary includes gathering data, performing calculations, evaluating investment options, determining the likelihood of any specific event occurring and recommending policies or investments to other people.

### Pricing Actuary
Pricing actuaries are statisticians who primarily work for financial industries or insurance companies. They use their analytical and math skills to determine the price of the products by analyzing data and calculating risks.

These types of actuaries collect and analyze statistical data to determine the claim payout in event of death, serious injury, property loss, disability or claims resulting from any casualties. They use this data to develop profitable yet competitive product pricing.

The decisions made by pricing actuaries should be high enough to cover the expenses and cost associated with insurance claims and to maximize the returns for insurance company. They are also involved in developing the policies and plans for new products and designing financially sound insurance and pension plans.

### Valuation Actuary
Valuation actuaries are responsible for calculating the reserves for life insurance and annuity companies, calculating the liabilities for financial statements and determining the valuation of the companies involved in mergers and acquisitions.

They ensure that the insurance company has enough reserves to pay for the expenses and claims that will be due in future. Once reserves are calculated they are also responsible for creating the source of earnings.

These types of actuaries use different valuation models to determine the reserves required by insurance company. In order to keep these valuation models up to date and accurate, they have to update the assumptions used in these models on an annual basis.

### Reinsurance Pricing Actuary
Like primary insurance, reinsurance is also a mechanism to spread out the risk. The reinsurer takes on some portion of the risk assumed by the primary insurer and charges an appropriate premium for that.

The main difference between reinsurance and primary insurance is that reinsurance contracts are more favorable to the buyer. The reinsurance pricing actuaries are responsible for estimating the risk and calculating the pricing of reinsurance contracts.

### Corporate Actuary
Corporate actuary is mostly involved either with product development or with financial reporting and valuation. They have special financial knowledge to analyze the results, feedback and the product pricing process.

Corporate actuaries also involved in corporate mergers and acquisitions, expense management, risk management, capital management, asset liability management and also in developing new performance measures for the company.

### Forensic Actuary
Forensic actuaries have a key role to play in providing litigation support in insurance and reinsurance cases. They serve as an expert witness where loss reserves and pricing issues are important. They can also act as arbitrators while resolving a dispute for insurance policy or reinsurance contract.
