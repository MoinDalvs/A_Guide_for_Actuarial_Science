### Learn about the key requirements, duties, responsibilities, and skills that should be in an actuarial analyst job description.

### What is an actuarial analyst?
Before we talk about what an actuarial analyst is, it’s important that you first understand what an actuary is. Because, an actuarial analyst is just the job title of someone that is working in a role as an actuary, but isn’t yet a fully qualified actuary.

#### Actuary Job Details
An actuary is someone that quantifies risk. They use statistics, probabilities, and financial concepts in order put a financial dollar value on an event that may or may not occur in the future.

They typically work in insurance companies determining how much to charge for insurance policies, or figuring out how much money an insurance company needs to save in order to keep their commitments to policyholders.

The key thing to understand here is that becoming a fully qualified actuary takes many years. Usually between 7-10 years actually. But anyone that is in the process of becoming an actuary can still work in the actuarial field (as an actuarial analyst) before they’re fully qualified.

#### Why work as an analyst?
This allows them to gain valuable work experience and industry knowledge well before they’re fully qualified. That’s important because fully qualified actuaries have a huge amount of responsibility and their job requires lots of professional judgement that can only be attained through years of experience.

So, sometimes the job title of an actuary that isn’t yet fully qualified is “actuarial analyst”. But this is just a job title. Another common job title (which means the exact same thing) is “actuarial associate”.

In some cases, the job title may just be “actuary”, “pricing actuary”, “valuation actuary” or something else along those lines. The job titles often vary from company to company.

#### What does an Actuarial analysts do?
Actuarial analysts use statistical models to analyze data and assess risk. Many industries employ actuarial analysts, but the insurance industry particularly uses their knowledge and skills to design and price insurance policies.

It’s most common for an actuarial analyst to be heavily involved in either the calculation of insurance premiums or reserves. Reserves are the industry term for the amount of assets (bonds, stocks, mortgages, private placements, etc.) that an insurance company needs to own in order to ensure that they are financially stable.

Since insurance contracts can last 50+ years, it’s important that insurance companies properly manage their cash flows to ensure they have enough money to pay any insurance claims that are made in the future. That’s why reserves are so important.

An actuarial analyst isn’t a fully qualified actuary and is still gaining knowledge and expertise in their industry. Because of this, they often do much of the technical work required in order for their immediate manager (usually a fully qualified actuary) and upper management to make informed decisions.

By doing much of the technical work, an actuarial analyst is able to dig deep into the details and fully understand how actuarial processes work, how reported values are calculated, and they’ll often investigate inconsistencies in data.

Having this in-depth insight into the business workings allows the actuarial analyst to develop in their career and become prepared for the requirements of a fully-qualified actuary.

### How do I become an actuarial analyst?
There are two primary requirements that are necessary in order to be an actuarial analyst. First, you need to get a Bachelor’s degree, and second you need to pass at least 1 actuarial exam.

### Bachelor’s Degree
Due to the nature of an actuarial analyst position, you need to be well-versed in topics such as finance, business, statistics and economics.

As a result, the first thing you’d need to do in order to become one is get a Bachelor’s degree. It doesn’t have to be a degree in one of the fields listed above, but it would be helpful in your career if it was. Actually, a degree technically isn’t required, but nearly all good candidates have one and an actuarial employer would be unlikely to hire someone without one.

Another option is to get your Bachelor’s degree in “actuarial science”. These courses are only offered in certain colleges and universities. They teach math concepts that are very specific to the actuarial field.

## Job Responsibilities are the Main Difference
Aside from those requirements and the salary, there is a big difference in the job responsibilities of an actuarial analyst and a fully qualified actuary.

### The Actuary
A fully-qualified actuary will often be using their knowledge and expertise in order to make critical business decisions. They’ll rely extensively on their past experiences in the industry, as well as concepts learned by studying for the later actuarial exams.

They’ll often use data summaries, industry reports, and company objectives in order to make decisions that are best for the company overall. To do this, an actuary will regularly collaborate with other actuaries in the company in order to get different perspectives, discover potential drawbacks and ideas.

Combining expertise in this way can be very powerful and reduces the possibility of overlooking potential issues that may arise in the future.

### The Actuarial Analyst
On the other hand, an actuarial analyst often isn’t involved in as many of these high-level, decision-making collaborations. Instead, the analyst is typically responsible for collecting, analysing and summarizing all the data that is needed for the fully-qualified actuaries to make their decisions.

The actuaries need to take into consideration many different factors when making decisions, and quite often it requires large amounts of data to be summarized into numbers that can easily be interpreted. This is where the analyst comes in.

The analyst will put everything together for the actuaries that they report to. This gives the actuaries more time for higher-level thinking and decision making rather than being caught up in the weeds of all the data.

Analysts are often also responsible for the monthly, quarterly, and annual reporting processes that need to be completed by the actuarial departments. These are often fairly manual processes that require the analyst to fully understand the data, calculations and results.

Although analysts may not attend all the collaboration meetings, their inputs and perspectives are still very valuable. Oftentimes the actuary that they’re providing data to doesn’t know all the nuances of the data, calculations and results that are produced.

So, an analyst can make them aware of any potential problems that may arise in the actual implementation of business changes and decisions.

As may be expected, the job responsibilities of an actuarial analyst are much more technical than those of an actuary. But both are needed in order to allow the insurance company to function.

### Actuarial Analyst vs Actuarial Assistant. Are they the same?
An actuarial analyst and an actuarial assistant are not the same job. An actuarial analyst does most of the technical work involving gathering, analysing, and interpreting data whereas an actuarial assistant often works alongside a team of actuarial analysts. The assistant will help do the tasks that need to be done but don’t require the expertise and skill set of the analysts.

In order to do their job, and actuarial analyst often needs to know how to write code to automate tasks. They also spend time formatting reports, cleaning data, and entering data into the computer.

But, these tasks aren’t really utilizing the specialized knowledge and analytical abilities of the analyst. So, it makes sense to have someone else do these tasks rather than the analyst. The analyst can then spend more time on understanding and interpreting results.

Having an actuarial assistant also makes sense from a financial standpoint because they don’t need to be paid as high of a salary as an actuarial analyst would.

Having actuarial assistants is a company choice. Some companies have them, and others don’t. But for someone looking to get into an actuarial analyst position, an actuarial assistant job can be very beneficial in making connections and learning about actuarial work.

## Is the actuarial analyst career right for you?
Most people don’t go into the actuarial profession without the intention to become a fully qualified actuary. The actuarial analyst job is a stepping stone on that journey. So, really, you have to think about whether a career as an actuary is right for you.

If you decide to stop pursuing a career as an actuary and stay as an actuarial analyst, you’ll be limited in your career growth opportunities and it may be difficult to switch companies (to another actuarial analyst position). Your exam process and work ethic will play a big part in whether this is possible.

#### You need to be goal oriented and persistent.
Getting through all the actuarial exams can be quite a long and difficult process. You need to be able to persevere through failures, and enjoy the challenge that each exam brings.

If you’re goal oriented, you’ll strive to complete the exams quickly, and the reward of a raise will motivate you.

#### Love problem solving.
Actuarial work regularly involves figuring out solutions to problems and a lot of judgement. Typically there’s no right or wrong answer in this field so it’s an analyst’s job to determine creative solutions and assess the advantages and disadvantages of each.

#### Enjoy math and working with numbers (a lot).
Actuaries work with numbers every single day. Most of them love to dig into the details and figure out why trends are occurring. Actuaries use numbers and mathematical concepts in order to make business decisions that are in the best interest of the company and its policyholders.

**`If you’re not good at math or don’t enjoy it, a career as an actuary likely won’t interest you for very long.`**
